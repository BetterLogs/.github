# BetterLogs

**Your logs deserve better than the console. Meet BetterLogs.**

BetterLogs **will be** *(I hope so)* a developer-first logging solution designed to replace the traditional `console.log` with an easy-to-use system. The goal is to make logging not only more readable.

## Objective

The core objective of BetterLogs is to simplify the way developers handle logs:

* **Centralize logs**: no more scattered console outputs across files and terminals.
* **Structured logs**: include context, metadata, and levels *(info, warning, error, debug)*.
* **Real-time visibility**: instantly see logs in a user-friendly dashboard.
* **Integrations**: send logs to services like Discord, Slack, or webhooks.

## Vision

BetterLogs is designed to evolve over time:

* **Phase 1 (OSS MVP)**: lightweight SDKs, local dashboard, basic log streaming, simple integrations.
* **Phase 2 (Hosted Version)**: cloud dashboard, multi-project support, long-term storage, alerting, and team collaboration.
* **Phase 3 (Advanced)**: full-featured logging platform with integrations, analytics, and optional enterprise deployment.

This README represents the **planning stage**: we're defining the architecture, features, and roadmap before diving into development. BetterLogs aims to be both **open-source friendly** and **hosted-ready**, giving developers the flexibility to self-host or use our cloud service (same thing Coolify is doing & I think is a good idea).
